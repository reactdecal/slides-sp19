## Course Logistics

<ul style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
  <Appear>
    <li>Lectures: Barrows 20 Thurs 6-7PM</li>
    <li>Labs: Barrows 20 Tuesday 6-7PM</li>
    <li style={{ marginLeft: "2em", paddingBottom: "0" }}>
      Labs are long but important!
    </li>
    <li>Weekly Attendance: 12 Weeks Total (20% of grade)</li>
    <li style={{ marginLeft: "2em" }}>0-2 unexcused = 20/20</li>
    <li style={{ marginLeft: "2em" }}>3-4 unexcused = 10/20</li>
    <li style={{ marginLeft: "2em" }}>5-6 unexcused = 0/20</li>
    <li style={{ marginLeft: "2em", paddingBottom: "0" }}>
      7+ unexcused = Automatic NP :(
    </li>
    <li> Pre-Requisites: CS61A and CS61B (Can be taken concurrently) </li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
Labs will cover content from the week before, and they will often be longer than you can finish in class. You are expected to finish them on your own time!

Let us know in advance if you need to leave early! Do so quietly and it's your responsibility to look up slides and catch up on material!

12 Weeks total of lecture. Final week is project presentations!

If you don't have the course prerequisites, the material will likely be very very difficult! And it'll be difficult for us to support you. We strongly recommend you take it another semester!
```

# Why are you here?

---

# What is React, anyway?

```notes
Talk to your neighbors and tell them a little bit about why you decided to take this course.
What is React, to the best of your knowledge?
```

---

# What is React, anyway?

React is a JavaScript library for **creating user interfaces**.

&mdash; <https://reactjs.org>

```notes
Facebook's official website tells us that React is a library for building user interfaces.
What that means is that we can use React to build a website's "view."
```

---

# What is React, anyway?

React is also a _mental model_ for writing components.
That means React is not just for websites!
