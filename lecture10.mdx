Ecosystem: The wide, wonderful, weird world of JavaScript

# How do we import JS into the browser?

- `<script>...</script>`
- Bower + `<script>...</script>`
- npm + Build step

---

# Importing a `<script>`

If you _really, really_ need jQuery:

```
<script
  src="https://cdnjs.../3.4.0/jquery.min.js"
>
</script>
```

---

# Bower

Don't

---

### _npm_ + Build step

- Install a package (`npm install jquery`)
- Import it in your project JS:

```
import $ from "jquery";
```

---

### npm + _Build step_

- `import`s aren't widely supported in browsers (_this is changing_)
- There are tools to convert `import`s to:

<img

  width="200"
/>

And that all gets stuck in a `<script>`!

# Setting up a React project

Turns out, this is really hard by yourself.

- Handy tool: `create-react-app`

```
npx create-react-app [folder of new project]
```
