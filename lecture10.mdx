# Lecture 10

Ecosystem: The wide, wonderful, weird world of JavaScript

---

# Client-Side JS vs Node

- Client's Browser receives JS as part of a webpage 
- Node is a runtime to run JS outside of a browser

---

# What is NPM

- Host and tool for JavaScript packages maintained by the community

[The largest package manager in the world](http://www.modulecounts.com/)

---

# Basics of working with npm 

```javascript
npm init // creates a new Javascript project (package.json)
npm install [dependency name] // installs package into your project
npm install //  installs all dependencies of your project
```

---

# package.json 

<div className="codesurfer">
  <CodeSurfer
    theme={ultramin}
    code={require("!raw-loader!./assets/code/package-example.js")}
    lang="javascript"
    showNumbers={false}
    dark={false}
    steps={[
      { notes: "This file describes your javascript project" },
      { notes: "Your project's dependencies live here!", lines:[8, 9, 10, 11, 12] },
      { notes: "File also defines some scripts. They work like aliases for longer commands", lines:[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] },
      {}
    ]}
  />
</div>

# What does it mean to install a dependency?

- `package.json` _describes_ your project's dependencies
- `npm install` looks them up, and downloads them locally!

Generated Files: 
- `node_modules` is the folder where the dependencies live  
- `package-lock.json` is a description of installed packages

# Other useful commands

```javascript
npm run [script name] // runs script from package.json
npm start // runs the "start" script from package.json
npm install [dep name] [dep name2] //  installs multiple dependencies at once!
```

---

# Why bother? 

1. Great ecosystem of build tools 
2. Easy package management! 

---

# How do we import JS into the browser?

- `<script>...</script>`
- Bower + `<script>...</script>`
- npm + Build step

---

# Importing a `<script>`

If you _really, really_ need jQuery:

```
<script
  src="https://cdnjs.../3.4.0/jquery.min.js"
>
</script>
```

---

# Bower

Don't

---

### _npm_ + Build step

- Install a package (`npm install jquery`)
- Import it in your project JS:

```
import $ from "jquery";
```

---

### npm + _Build step_

- `import`s aren't widely supported in browsers (_this is changing_)
- There are tools to convert `import`s to:

<img
  src="https://cl.ly/8c20881b0ae7/Image%2525202019-04-18%252520at%2525204.30.05%252520PM.png"
  width="200"
/>

And that all gets stuck in a `<script>`!

# Setting up a React project

Turns out, this is really hard by yourself.

- Handy tool: `create-react-app`

```
npx create-react-app [folder of new project]
```
