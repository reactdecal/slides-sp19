# Agenda

**Overall:** Things you'll run into in Project 2.

- Some syntactical tricks
- More about the `key` prop
- More about the `children` prop

---

# Props Spreading

```jsx
const schoolInfo = { school: "UC Berkeley", year: 1868 };
<School {...schoolInfo} />;
```

---

# Conditional Rendering

```jsx
<div>{this.props.name ? <p>{this.props.name}</p> : null}</div>
```

---

### What is `this`?

```jsx
// 1. In constructor:
this.onChange = this.onChange.bind(this);
// 2. In the prop:
<input onChange={e => this.onChange(e)} />;
// 3. In the function definition:
onChange = e => {};
```

### The `key` prop

Helps React know what elements need to persist across list reorders

```jsx
this.state.items.map(item => {
  return <p key={item.id}>{item.name}</p>;
});
```
