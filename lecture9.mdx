# Lecture 9

Finishing up Advanced React!

---

# Agenda

**Overall:** Things you'll run into in Project 2.

- Some syntactical tricks
- More about the `key` prop
- More about the `children` prop

---

# Props Spreading

```jsx
const schoolInfo = { school: "UC Berkeley", year: 1868 };

// Both are equivalent!
<School {...schoolInfo} />;
<School school="UC Berkeley" year={1868} />
```

---

# Conditional Rendering

```jsx
<div>{this.props.name ? <p>{this.props.name}</p> : null}</div>
<div>{this.props.name && <p>{this.props.name}</p>}</div> // Also works
```

---

# Demo

What's up with `this` anyway?

---

### What is `this`?

```jsx
// 1. In constructor:
this.onChange = this.onChange.bind(this);
// 2. In the prop:
<input onChange={e => this.onChange(e)} />;
// 3. In the function definition:
onChange = e => {};
```

---

### The `key` prop

Helps React know what elements need to persist across list reorders

```jsx
this.state.items.map(item => {
  return <p key={item.id}>{item.name}</p>;
});
```

---

# The `children` prop

```jsx
// The JSX between <SomeComponent> tags get passed in as a prop called `children`
<SomeComponent> 
  <Book title="Book 1" />
  <Book title="Book 1" />
</SomeComponent>
```
