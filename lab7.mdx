Project 1 due 

---

### What is a network request?

---

## Making requests in JS

```
fetch("https://www.facebook.com") // returns a Promise
await fetch("https://www.facebook.com") // returns a Response object 

# Getting the text out of a response
let res = await fetch("https://www.reactdecal.org")
let responseText = await res.text();
```

---

# Why is this useful?

- We write webpages to help us display data!
- Network requests help us ask servers for this data 
- Tons of public, free data sources (APIs) exist on the web
