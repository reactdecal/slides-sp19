# Welcome to Lecture 7

### Today will be fun!

---

# Agenda

1. JS Tidbits
2. Props vs. State
3. Thinking in React

---

# Announcements

- Grades and feedback will be out by the end of break!
- Project 1 Part 2 Released! Get started soon :) 

---

# JS Tidbit 1: Template Strings 

```javascript 
let firstName = "Aivant"
let lastName = "Goyal"

// Method 1: 
console.log("Hi my name is " + firstName + " " + lastName)

// Method 2: 
console.log(`Hi my name is ${firstName} ${lastName}`)
```

---

# JS Tidbit 2: Destructuring

```javascript
const product = {name: "Apple", price: 2, limit: 10}

// Normal Way:
let name = product.name 
let price = product.price 

// Destructuring: 
let {name, price} = product
```
---

# JS Tidbit 2: Destructuring 

```javascript 
// props = {name: "Orange", price: 0.5}
render() { 
    let {name, price} = this.props
    return (<h1>{name} is ${price})
}
```

Super easy to get values out of an object! 

---

# JS Tidbit 2: Destructuring Arrays

```javascript
const person = ["Aivant", "Goyal", 19]

// Normal Way:
let firstName = person[0]
let lastName = person[1]

// Destructuring: 
let [firstName, lastName] = person
let [, , age] = person
```
 
Also works for arrays! 

---

# JS Tidbit 3: Mutability

```javascript 
let numbers = [1, 2, 3]
// What's the difference?
let result1 = numbers.push(4) 
let result2 = numbers.concat(4)
```

---

# JS Tidbit 3: Mutability

`.push()` modifies the _existing_ array 

`.concat()` returns a _new_ array!


Why is this important?

---

# State is Immutable!

```javascript 
// Constructor: 
this.state = { goals: [] }

// Adding a Goal (BAD)
this.setState({goals: this.state.goals.push("New Goal!")})

// Adding a Goal (OKAY)
this.setState({goals: this.state.goals.concat("New Goal!")})

// Adding a Goal (GOOD)
this.setState((prevState) => {goals: oldState.goals.concat("New Goal!")})
```

---

# JS Tidbit 4: Spreading 

```javascript
arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
arr2 = [...arr1] // clones arr1
arr3 = [...arr1, 4, 5] // creates new array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

obj1 = {a: "foo", b: "bar"}
obj2 = {...obj1} // clones obj1
obj3 = {...obj1, c: "world"} // clones and adds keys to obj1
```

---

# JS Tidbit 4: Spreading 

```javascript
let arr1 = ["Goal 1", "Goal 2"]

// Old:
let arr2 = arr1.concat("New Goal!")

// New: 
let arr3 = [...arr1, "New Goal!"]
```

---

# NO MORE CODE! 

## Let's Draw :) 

---

# Thinking in React 

## Get into groups and pull out some paper!
